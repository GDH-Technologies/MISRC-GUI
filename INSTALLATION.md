# Building and installing MISRC GUI from source

End users should grab prebuilt binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/harrypm/MISRC-GUI/releases). This document is for building from source (development, custom toolchains, or platforms without a prebuilt release).

## Prerequisites

### Windows
- [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) with the `MINGW64` environment and these packages:
  `mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-fftw mingw-w64-x86_64-flac mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-libusb mingw-w64-x86_64-libsoxr mingw-w64-x86_64-meson mingw-w64-x86_64-nasm mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja mingw-w64-x86_64-pkgconf`
- Python 3 (for Meson; the bootstrap script auto-installs user-level `meson` + `ninja` if missing)
- `nasm` (provided by the MSYS2 package above)

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
`cmake git meson ninja-build nasm pkg-config libfftw3-dev libflac-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libuvc-dev libsoxr-dev libasound2-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev`

### macOS (Homebrew)
`cmake fftw flac libusb libuvc libsoxr meson nasm ninja pkgconf`

> libFLAC >= 1.5.0 is required for multithreaded FLAC encode. On Ubuntu 22.04 the apt `libflac-dev` is stuck at 1.3.3, so use the prebuilt cache flow or build 1.5.0 from source (CI does this — see `.github/workflows/build.yml`).

## Local build quick start

### Windows (PowerShell)

If local builds fail because `meson` is missing from `PATH`, bootstrap the toolchain first:

```powershell
pwsh -File scripts/build-local.ps1 -BootstrapOnly
```

That command auto-installs user-level `meson` + `ninja` (when missing) and validates the local toolchain connection.

Then run the build:

```powershell
pwsh -File scripts/build-local.ps1
```

### Linux/macOS (bash)

```bash
scripts/build-local.sh
```

Both entry points auto-build the vendored dependencies (see below) on first run and reuse them afterward, so a single command produces a working binary with no manual deps step.

## Vendored deps caching model (local == CI)

hsdaoh, libuvc, and raylib are not available as system packages on all platforms, so they are built from source into `.deps/install` (mirroring the CI `windows-exe` / `linux-appimage` / `macos-app-build` deps blocks). The deps build is stamp-gated: a content-addressed hash of the hsdaoh source tree + raylib tag + libuvc ref + system dep versions is stored in `.deps/install/.build-stamp`; the build skips instantly when the stamp matches, so new terminals and CI runs reuse until an input changes.

- **Windows**: `scripts/build-local.ps1` auto-invokes `scripts/build-deps-windows.sh` (via MSYS2 MINGW64) on first run or when inputs change. No manual deps step needed.
- **Linux/macOS**: `scripts/build-local.sh` auto-invokes `scripts/build-deps-unix.sh` on first run or when inputs change.
- **CI**: `actions/cache@v4` on `.deps/install` (keyed on `hashFiles(third_party/hsdaoh/**)` + raylib/libuvc versions) skips the rebuild on cache hit.
- **Prebuilt publishing**: `scripts/publish-deps-cache.sh <platform> <arch>` packages `.deps/install` into a tar.xz + sha256 for upload to `harrypm/MISRC-ci-cache` (mirrors the existing libFLAC cache flow), so cold starts can download instead of compiling.

The local==CI contract is enforced by `python misrc_tools/test/ci_guard_tests.py --static-only`.

## Output

- Windows: `build-local/misrc_gui.exe`
- Linux/macOS: `build-local/misrc_gui`

Run `misrc_gui --smoke-test` to verify the binary is functional (same assertion CI uses).

On a HiDPI display the UI scales itself to match the desktop at startup. If it
still looks wrong, `Ctrl` + mouse wheel (`Cmd` on macOS) or `Ctrl` `+`/`-`/`0`
adjusts it between 75% and 300%, and Settings → UI scale exposes the same
control. `misrc_gui --debug-view` logs what was detected. See
[UI Scale (HiDPI displays)](README.md#ui-scale-hidpi-displays) in the README.
