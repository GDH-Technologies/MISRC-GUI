/*
 * MISRC GUI - Direct native RAW record path
 *
 * Byte-exact passthrough recording for capture backends whose native device
 * stream is already the output format (CXADC with FLAC off and per-channel
 * resampling off). The device capture thread pushes the exact bytes it read
 * into the channel's record ringbuffer (BUF_RECORD_A/B) via
 * gui_record_direct_push(); gui_record_direct_writer_thread fwrites those
 * bytes unchanged, so the output file is the card's byte stream 1:1
 * (8-bit mode -> unsigned .u8 bytes, tenbit mode -> unsigned .u16 words).
 *
 * Ordering contract (producer + writer):
 * - Producer: while the spill backlog is non-zero, new bytes go to the spill
 *   so they queue behind the not-yet-drained spill data.
 * - Writer: drain the ringbuffer first (oldest data), then the spill.
 * Together these keep the byte stream in order under backpressure. The
 * legacy path can reorder because it retries the ringbuffer as soon as any
 * space appears while older data still sits in the spill file.
 *
 * Tail drain: the writer reads whatever is available (variable length), so
 * the final partial block at recording stop is written too. The legacy
 * fixed-block RAW writer breaks at stop with less than one full block left
 * and loses it.
 *
 * The module has no raylib/gui_app dependency so this contract is
 * unit-testable (test/gui_record_direct_harness.c): every session
 * interaction (spill file, capture log, accounting atomics, write-error
 * flag) is injected through the context.
